"""
A Graph is a data structure that consists of the following two components:

    A finite set of vertices also called nodes.
    A finite set of ordered pair of the form (u, v) called as edge

    Real life example : Google GPS , Facebook ,Linkedin

Directed Graphs: The Directed graphs are such graphs in which edges are directed in a single
direction.
Undirected Graphs : Undirected graphs are such graphs in which the edges are directionless
or in other words bi-directional.


Following two are the most commonly used representations of a graph:
    1) Adjacency Matrix.
    2) Adjacency List.
